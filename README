Plugin to play a sound when starting/stopping
streaming/recording/buffer or pausing/unpausing
recording.

===WINDOWS===
Windows is built and working for both 32bit and 64bit
Has all required .dlls

Drag and drop obs-studio folder into C:\Program Files
(or wher ever you have obs-studio installed)
Merge all files down and you should be good to go.

===LINUX===
Dependancies:
obs (duh)
ffmpeg (you should have this if you have a working obs)
SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer, see https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

I provide binaries for Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS 64bit for the PPA
version of OBS
Just run
	>make install
and it should install for you in the right places. If it
doesn't, you may have to check the paths to FFmpeg, SDL2 and
OBS and fix as necessary.

=For others=, compile and install with
	>make
	>make install
		#NOTE# make install may not work. See below.

I've provided a best guess for make install. If your files
are set up how I think they will be, put SRBeep-bin into
the obs-studio folder, uncomment the bottom secion and
comment out the install: and clean: bits that aren't
commented.

You'll probably have to move the .so.## for ffmpeg into
/usr/lib/
but obs-studio should throw a warning for each .so.## (one at a
time) when it tries to load the module to tell you what they are.
They should be in the ffmpeg/lib folder (where ever that may be
for you)

===MAC===
Uh, sould work. Probably. Don't have a MAC to test with.
So...
You can try the "For others" bit of LINUX
Let me know if you get it to work!
